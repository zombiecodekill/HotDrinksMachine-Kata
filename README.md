# HotDrinksMachine-Kata
Hot Drinks Machine Refactoring Kata

Welcome to the hot drinks machine.

This application has been lovingly created and maintained by Alan of AcmeHotDrinks Ltd for the past 20 years. 
Alan loves nothing more than to write his special code in his favourite editor, Notepad.

Unfortunately due to a recent management reorganization he was found to be surplus to requirements.

The customers have requested some new features that were never finished by Alan.

They would like:

- To make Latte coffee
- To make Mocha coffee
- To make Java coffee
- To make Caff√® macchiato
- To make Cappuccino
- To make Expresso coffee
- To make Tea with milk instead of lemon
- To be able to add sugar to the Tea
- To be able to make coffee without sugar
- To be able to make coffee without milk
- To be able to refill the machine when it runs out of ingredients
- If the machine runs out of cups, do not spill the drinks on the floor

There have also been a couple of suggestions made about the UI:

- It would be great to see the full readout of steps without needing to keep clicking the OK button
- To adjust the colours enough to stop the customers eyeballs from bleeding.
